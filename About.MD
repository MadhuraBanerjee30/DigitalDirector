# Introduction
Every new business relation needs a round of communications. Communication is made more effective with the use of visual tools, and specifically, presentations. Professing information from a presentation involves conveying relevant data and answering questions related to it. A new frontier in technology explores these features of communication by building a virtual director, that integrates augmented reality tools, and virtually demonstrates a presentation.
